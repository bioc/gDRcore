# Changes to v.0.1.12 - 2020.06.10
- support an import of single agent data from GDS
  * including the masked field to be able to remove the masked data from averages
  * add a function to annotate drug combinations (add_codrug_group)
  * update the tests that contained combination experiments accordingly.
  * add new tests for the GDS data
  * minor refactor to use the 'masked' column. If it is not part of the initial dataframe it is added automatically (and set to FALSE)
